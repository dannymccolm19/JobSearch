# JobSearch
This is a Job Search application created by me using react.
To run simply run 'npm install' and then 'node index.js' in the terminal while in the project directory.
The Jobs are stored in a json file and have a job title that includes the location, as well as a number of categories that are relevent to the job.
The app allows you to view a list of all categories with their number of occurences and also search for jobs by location or category.
Note that the search functions are case sensitive.
Also remote listings will show up for every city search regardless of what you input.
